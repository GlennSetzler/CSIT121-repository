<h2>The Food Pizza</h2>
<p><br><br> For our first project, I said my favorite food was Chilli but, like my favorite movie, I don't have just one favorite food. I also mentioned that I chose Chilli because it was one of the first things I learned to cook and I made the recipe my self. Now as for pizza, I have never made it my self; I made one attempt that failed and haven't tried since. I like extra cheess and onion on my pizza normaly and sometimes I get something other than onion or I'll just get extra cheess.<br><br><br>
