<h2>The Game Minecraft</h2>
<p>As with my favorite movie and favorite food, I don't just have one favorite game. I love the Borderlands series and sometimes I play Fortnite with frends, but the one game I keep coming back to, no matter how long of a break from it I take, is Minecraft. Personally, I don't know why, but I just keep getting drawn in by things about Minecraft. No matter how boring the game got for me, any news or info about Minecraft always got my attention.
